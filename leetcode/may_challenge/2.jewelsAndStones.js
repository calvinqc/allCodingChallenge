/**
 * 
  You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

  The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

  Example 1:

  Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
  Output: 3
  Example 2:

  Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
  Output: 0
  Note:

  S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
  The characters in J are distinct.

/**
 * @param {string} J
 * @param {string} S
 * @return {number}

var numJewelsInStones = function(J, S) {
  return S.split("").filter(stone => J.split("").includes(stone)).length;

/**
 * Lesson Learned:
 * 1. If I want to loop through a String, use split("") to convert into array of characters
 * 2. Use map, reduce, filter
 *    a. filter:  Remove items which donâ€™t satisfy a condition
 *        Ex: Selecting candidates who passed the test
 *
 *    b. map:     Executes a function on each element of an array
 *        Ex: Conducting a test for multiple candidates
 *
 *    c. reduce:  Creates a single value from elements of Array
 *        Ex: Creating a team from the selected candidates
