## [1.isBadVersion.js](https://github.com/calvinqc/allCodingChallenge/tree/master/leetcode/may_challenge/1.isBadVersion.js)

1. Think simply, sometimes use while instead of for loop

2. Binary search if you know the answer should be in the other half.

## [2.jewelsAndStones.js](https://github.com/calvinqc/allCodingChallenge/tree/master/leetcode/may_challenge/2.jewelsAndStones.js)

1. If you want to loop through a String, use split("") to convert into array of characters

2. Use **map, reduce, filter**

- **filter**: Remove items which donâ€™t satisfy a condition

  - Ex: Selecting candidates who passed the test

- **map**: Executes a function on each element of an array

  - Ex: Conducting a test for multiple candidates

- **reduce**: Creates a single value from elements of Array
  - Ex: Creating a team from the selected candidates

## [3.ransomNote.js](https://github.com/calvinqc/allCodingChallenge/tree/master/leetcode/may_challenge/3.ransomNote.js)

1. Using for...of or regular for loop instead of map, forEach, etc. for async

2. Always spend another 15' to learn from other solutions, and try those to learn about time and space.

3. avoid create new array, sets for better memory usage.

## [4.ransomNote.js](https://github.com/calvinqc/allCodingChallenge/tree/master/leetcode/may_challenge/4.findComplement.js)

1. Learn to use [bitwise operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators)

2. Learn flags and bitmasks
   - Binary flags take much less memory (by a factor of 32).
   - A bitmask is a sequence of bits that can manipulate and/or read flags
